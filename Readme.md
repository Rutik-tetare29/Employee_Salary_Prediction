## 🔧 Data Processing Pipeline

### Preprocessing Steps Implemented
```python
# 1. Data Quality Assessment
data.shape                    # (32,561, 15) initial
data.isna().sum()            # No null values
data.dtypes                  # Mixed types detected

# 2. Missing Value Handling
workclass_missing = 1,836    # "?" entries
occupation_missing = 1,843   # "?" entries
# Solution: Replace with "Others"

# 3. Outlier Management  
age_outliers = 547          # Ages > 75 or < 17
education_outliers = 2,293   # Years > 16 or < 5
# Solution: Statistical filtering

# 4. Category Consolidation
removed_categories = ["Without-pay", "Never-worked"]
final_shape = (30,718, 13)  # After cleaning

# 5. Feature Encoding
categorical_features = 7     # Label encoded
numerical_features = 6       # Scaled for linear models
```

### Model Training Configuration
```python
# Train-test split
train_size = 24,574 (80%)
test_size = 6,144 (20%)
random_state = 42

# Cross-validation approach
scaling_strategy = "Conditional"  # Linear models only
evaluation_metric = "Accuracy"
model_selection = "Best performer"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Model Files Missing**
```bash
Problem: "best_model.pkl not found"
Solution: Run the complete Jupyter notebook
Command: jupyter notebook "employee salary prediction.ipynb"
Action: Execute all cells to generate model files
```

**Feature Mismatch Error**
```bash
Problem: "fnlwgt feature missing"
Solution: Ensure all 13 features are provided
Fix: Added fnlwgt input field in Financial Info tab
```

**Encoding Errors**
```bash
Problem: LabelEncoder unknown categories
Solution: Use predefined category lists
Implementation: initialize_encoders() function
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
Problem: Slow prediction response
Solution: Model caching with @st.cache_resource
Optimization: Conditional scaling for model types
```
